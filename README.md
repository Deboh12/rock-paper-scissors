# Rock-Paper-Scissors

## Description

I was motivated to build this Rock-Paper-Scissors project as a practical exercise to enhance my coding skills and create an engaging, interactive game using JavaScript. The project serves as both a learning opportunity and a source of entertainment for users. By developing a classic game, I aimed to apply my programming knowledge in handling user input, implementing game logic, and using JavaScript functions for interaction. While working on this project, I deepened my understanding of random number generation, conditional statements, and the overall process of creating a simple game. The Rock-Paper-Scissors game doesn't address a specific problem but provides an enjoyable experience for users, reinforcing key programming concepts.

## Usage

To play the Rock-Paper-Scissors game:

1. Open the game in your browser.
2. Enter your choice when prompted (R, P, or S).
3. See the result and game statistics.
4. Choose to play again or end the game.
