# Rock-Paper-Scissors

## Link to Deployed Application

## Description

I was motivated to build this Rock-Paper-Scissors project as a practical exercise to enhance my coding skills and create an engaging, interactive game using JavaScript. The project serves as both a learning opportunity and a source of entertainment for users. By developing a classic game, I aimed to apply my programming knowledge in handling user input, implementing game logic, and using JavaScript functions for interaction. While working on this project, I deepened my understanding of random number generation, conditional statements, and the overall process of creating a simple game. The Rock-Paper-Scissors game doesn't address a specific problem but provides an enjoyable experience for users, reinforcing key programming concepts.

## Usage

To play the Rock-Paper-Scissors game:

1. Open the game in your browser.

2. Enter your choice when prompted (R, P, or S).
